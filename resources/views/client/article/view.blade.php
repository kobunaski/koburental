                            <h2>Three Ways To Get Travel Discounts</h2>

                            <p>It is particularly annoying to get younger kids to cooperate during travel. But it is not their fault, because at their age they are naturally more inquisitive and more active. They are not content to stay put and lounge in the beach or hotel.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                They want lots of actions, something that your dream beach vacation cannot satisfy. Why not change your dream relaxation vacation to a fun family holiday? Virginia travel offers two exciting and affordable theme parks for your family’s enjoyment.</p>

                            <img src="client_assets/assets/images/blog/blog_image_02.jpg" alt="">

                            <p>These theme parks are not prohibitively-priced, meaning you can still afford to stay at nice hotels. Hotels dot the Virginian landscape, and are especially near the theme parks. After all, there is no better way to end a fun afternoon than by sleeping in a cozy room.
                                <br><br>
                                Although these theme parks are not like Disneyland which have its own hotel, the thrill rides and sights more than suffice for this shortcoming. Paramount’s Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens Williamsburg make Virginia travel something the whole family can enjoy.
                            </p>

                            <p>Paramount’s Kings Dominion boasts of being a water and theme park in one. It is a 400-acre affair with over 200 attractions and rides.
                                <br><br>
                                International roller coaster fanatics troop to Kings Dominion for its 13 famous and world-class coasters. Teenagers and daring adults alike enjoy the thrilling loops and drops of these coasters.

                                The park features Hypersonic XLC, the only American coaster that uses compressed air for launch power.

                                There are two rides that are inspired by major motion pictures.
